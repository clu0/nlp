# Learning Transformers

First we will try to reproduce Karpathy's decoder-only transformer on the tiny Shakespeare dataset. Then we can try to do the encoder-decoder for german-english translation later.

For tiny Shakespeare, download the data with `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt`.

## Data
Using the Shakespeare dataset in `input.txt`, which contains about 40k lines.
